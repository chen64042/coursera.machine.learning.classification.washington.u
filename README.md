# Machine Learning - Classification, by Washington University
## Goals & Approaches
1. Use about Scikit-learn, numpy and pandas for the assignments
2. Initially (week 1), still use Graphlab to complete the homework and re-write it in Scikit-learn etc
3. Eventually (week 2 and onward ...), use Scikit-learn only
4. Have a python.practice notebook in each week to play around different things
5. Learn how to write OO Python and reuse codes in notebook

## Install scikit-learn and other packages
1. Open a termnial, type <code>source activate gl-env</code>. This enters anaconda environment for this class. The environment should have been configured properly in class 1, the foundation
2. Type <code>pip install -U scikit-learn</code> to install scikit-learn
3. Type <code>pip install --user numpy scipy matplotlib ipython jupyter pandas sympy nose</code> to install other packages. Some should have been installed already.
